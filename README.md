# Draggable

This module is designed to empower Roblox developers to easily implement draggable functionality for their [GuiObjects](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/GuiObject). With intuitive methods, developers can enhance user interactions by making GUI elements draggable within the game environment.

See the [documentation](https://destinecarma.github.io/draggable/) for more information.
